### Peer Reviewer Notes for SQL Query Analysis

#### Context:

This query is designed to analyze the revenue generated from different product categories on a daily basis. 
The data is sourced from several tables in the 'brooklyndata' schema, which contains information about orders, products, and payments.
The query is structured using multiple CTEs to break down the analysis into manageable parts and to promote code reusability.
Please pay special attention to the calculation of the 'percentage' metric in the 'ranked_category' CTE to ensure the accuracy of the revenue percentage calculation.

#### Open Questions:

1. Is the method of calculating 'total_bill' in the 'order_category' CTE the most accurate approach?
2. Are there any potential data quality issues we should be aware of in the source tables?

#### Client Notes:

1. In this query, we have made an assumption that the 'payment_value' field in the 'olist_order_payments_dataset' table represents the total revenue generated from an order, including both product price and freight value. We would like to confirm if this assumption is correct.
2. We have also assumed that the 'product_category_name' in the 'olist_products_dataset' table accurately represents the categories of the products in the orders. Could you please confirm if this information is up-to-date and accurate?

### Peer Review Comments for `load_csvs_to_snowflake_table` Function

#### Context:

This script is designed to facilitate the bulk import of data from multiple large CSV files (ranging from 50 to 100GB each) into a specified table in a Snowflake database. The script is expected to be used by clients who wish to upload data from a folder on their local machine to their Snowflake database. The script uses SQLAlchemy for database connection and interactions, and Pandas for data handling and manipulation.

#### Notable Approaches:

1. **Modular Function Design**: The `load_csvs_to_snowflake_table` function is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into larger data pipeline workflows.
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling has been implemented to catch and report errors at various stages of the data loading process, without halting the entire operation.
3. **Data Verification**: Before data insertion, the script verifies the alignment between the columns in the CSV files and the columns in the target Snowflake table, and adjusts the data insertion strategy accordingly.
4. **Bulk Insertion with Chunking**: To manage memory usage and enhance performance, data is inserted in chunks of 5000 rows at a time, which should help in efficiently handling large datasets.

#### Open Questions and Concerns:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Given the large size of the individual CSV files (50-100GB each), the current chunk size of 5000 rows has been chosen as a starting point. It might be beneficial to experiment with different chunk sizes to find the optimal balance between memory usage and performance.
2. **Logging and Monitoring**: Currently, the script prints error messages to the console. Implementing a more comprehensive logging system to record both errors and successful operations might be a valuable addition.
3. **Testing with Real Data**: The script needs to be tested with real data to identify potential areas of improvement and to ensure that it meets the client's requirements in terms of data integrity and performance.
4. **Security Considerations**: Before deploying the script in a production environment, it would be prudent to review and enhance the security measures, especially concerning the handling of database credentials.

### Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Ensure Python 3.8 is installed on your system.

   - Install necessary Python packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

     ```bash
     pip install sqlalchemy pandas snowflake-sqlalchemy
     ```

2. **Setting Up the Script**:

   - Open the `snowflake_bulk_importer.py` script in a text editor.
   - Replace the placeholders (`your_snowflake_account`, `your_snowflake_username`, etc.) with your actual Snowflake credentials and details.
   - Set `CSV_FOLDER_PATH` to the path of the folder on your computer that contains the CSV files you want to upload.

3. **Running the Script**:

   - Save the script after making the necessary changes.

   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

   - Run the script using the following command:

     ```bash
     python snowflake_bulk_importer.py
     ```

4. **Monitoring the Script**:

   - The script will print error messages if it encounters any issues during the data loading process. Check the console output for any error messages and adjust the script or data files as necessary.

### Enhancements for Production Use

To transition the `load_csvs_to_snowflake_table` function from a development stage to a production-ready tool, several enhancements and optimizations would be necessary. Here are some of the key changes I would propose:

1. **Configuration File for Credentials**: Instead of hardcoding the Snowflake credentials within the script, I would recommend utilizing a configuration file or environment variables to securely manage and store sensitive information. This would enhance the security and flexibility of the script.
2. **Comprehensive Logging System**: Implement a comprehensive logging system to track the progress of data uploads and record any errors or issues that occur during the process. This would facilitate easier debugging and monitoring of the data loading process.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Given the large size of the CSV files, incorporating parallel processing could significantly reduce the data loading time. This could be achieved by using Python's multiprocessing module to parallelize the reading and writing of data.
4. **Data Validation and Cleaning**: Before inserting data into the Snowflake database, implement data validation and cleaning steps to ensure data quality and integrity. This could include checking for missing values, data type validations, and other data quality checks.
5. **Automated Testing**: Develop a suite of automated tests to verify the functionality of the script and to ensure that any future changes do not introduce regressions. This would be crucial for maintaining the reliability of the script in a production environment.
6. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Enhance the error handling mechanisms to include retry logic for transient errors, ensuring that temporary issues do not cause the entire data loading process to fail.
7. **Documentation and User Guide**: Create detailed documentation and a user guide to assist clients in setting up and using the script effectively. This should include step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for using the script.
8. **Performance Tuning**: Conduct performance tuning to optimize the script for handling large datasets efficiently. This could involve experimenting with different chunk sizes and optimizing the data handling processes to reduce memory usage and improve speed.

By implementing these changes, the `load_csvs_to_snowflake_table` function would be better equipped to handle the demands of a production environment, offering improved performance, reliability, and usability.
